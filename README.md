# pH Sensor Calibration and Reading

#### Project Overview

This project involves reading and calibrating pH values from a pH sensor connected to an Arduino board. The sensor's analog readings are processed to determine the pH level of the solution being tested, with results displayed on the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Board**
2. **pH Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**
4. **Breadboard (optional)**

### Block Diagram



#### Pin Connections

- **pH Sensor:**
  - **Signal Pin (S)**: Connect to analog pin A1 on the Arduino
  - **Power Pin (V+ or VCC)**: Connect to the Arduino's 5V pin
  - **Ground Pin (GND)**: Connect to the Arduino's GND pin

#### Instructions

1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
   - Connect the pH sensor to the Arduino board as per the pin connections mentioned above.
   - Ensure all connections are secure and properly grounded.

2. **Initialize Serial Communication:**
   - Begin serial communication at a baud rate of 9600 to enable data transmission between the Arduino and a connected device (e.g., computer).

3. **Read and Process pH Sensor Data:**
   - In the `loop()` function, read the analog voltage value from the pH sensor connected to the specified analog pin (A1).
   - Store the sensor readings in an array and sort the array to filter out noise and get a stable reading.
   - Calculate the average of the middle values from the sorted array to ensure a more accurate pH reading.

4. **Calibrate and Display pH Values:**
   - Convert the averaged sensor value to a voltage.
   - Apply a calibration formula to convert the voltage to a pH value using a predetermined calibration value.
   - Print the calibrated pH value to the Serial Monitor.

5. **Delay and Repeat:**
   - Use the `delay()` function to introduce a short delay between sensor readings, ensuring stability and preventing data flooding in the Serial Monitor.

#### Applications

- **Water Quality Monitoring:** Use the setup to monitor and measure the pH levels of various water samples, essential for environmental and agricultural applications.
- **Chemical Experiments:** Integrate the pH sensor in laboratory experiments to measure the acidity or alkalinity of different solutions.
- **Educational Projects:** Demonstrate the principles of pH measurement and sensor calibration in educational settings using this simple yet effective project.
